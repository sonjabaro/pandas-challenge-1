# pandas-challenge-1
Week 4 challenge

This week's challenge had us apply pandas methods to prepare data and analyze the data. 

The challenge demonstrates applying key tasks such as importing data into the python envirnonment, exploring the data to learn the elements within the data, transforming the data by applying functions to highlight insights hidden within the data.

We also summarized the data to answer abstract questions all to support critical thinking using Pandas tools to inform.

My challenge efforts were supported via a number of avenues - attending office hours, meeting with the "mountain-lovers study group" to review the previous night's activities, meeting with the weekend study group, reviewing code with eachother, using Chat GPT to find functions and help debug code.

My personal accomplishment in this challenge was the ability to discern what the code needed to do, apply coding from the exercises and identify ways to answer my questions of "can we do this more simply?" I'm at a place now where if I don't recall the exact command or syntax I can find out how to get it right but generally understand what I need to do to seek out the correct syntax and code.

Where I believe I shine is in asking the questions of the data that will bring out meaningful business insights and potential actions.
